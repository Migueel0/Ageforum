# AGE OF EMPIRES IV: SPANISH FORUM

Age of Empires IV was published on Thursday 28th of October. Lorenzo and I realized that there´re no Spanish forums about this game and we decided to create one of the first forums to the spanish-speaker comunity,

## TOOLS:

To make it possible we are using the following softwares:

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - As web framework
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - As Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

## CODE STRUCTURE
We can divide this proyect in 3 different splits:

* **1 Database:** We are working with SQLite database where we are saving all forum data like usersnames,posts etc.Probably,later,we will change the database into another SQL. 
* **2 Frontend development:** For web development, we´re using HTML for the webpage structure,css and Bootstrap for webpage design and Django for the comunication with the backend.
* **3 Backend development:** As we´re using Django, the Backend lenguaje used is Python.

## FORUM STRUCTURE
* As any forum, this will have a posting area that will be sorted with an index where title´s post will be shown.
* To see the posts, have an account is not required but if you want to write in it you will have to sign up and create an account.
* When you have the account, you can start to write in the forum once you log in.
* Your profile will be shown with an username and a profile photo.
* To post, you just write a title and the message body. Other users will can reply your post.
* Don´t worry about toxic community, we are working to create a report system to ban all non respectfully users ;)
